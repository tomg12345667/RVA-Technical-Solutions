## Setup

### 1. Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** → name it
3. Go to **Bot** tab → click **Add Bot**
4. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - ✅ Server Members Intent
   - ✅ Message Content Intent
5. Copy the **Token** (you'll need it in `.env`)

### 2. Invite the Bot

Use this OAuth2 URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`):

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=8&scope=bot
```

Or manually select these permissions:
- Manage Channels
- View Channels
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Read Message History
- Manage Messages

### 3. Install & Configure

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
PANEL_CHANNEL_ID=the_channel_id_for_the_ticket_button
TICKET_CATEGORY_ID=optional_category_id_for_ticket_channels
```

**To get a channel ID:** Right-click the channel in Discord → Copy Channel ID  
*(Enable Developer Mode in Discord Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode)*

### 4. Start the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Deploy the Panel

In Discord, go to the channel where you want the ticket panel and type:

```
?sendpanel
```

Staff roles only. The command message is silently deleted, leaving just the clean panel embed.

## Staff Role IDs

The two staff roles are hardcoded in `index.js`:

```js
const STAFF_ROLE_1 = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
const STAFF_ROLE_2 = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
```

Change these if needed.
